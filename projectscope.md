# Project Scope: AI-Powered Project Management System

## Detailed Description

This project is an AI-powered project management system that leverages natural language processing and machine learning to assist users in managing their projects more efficiently. The system allows users to create projects, define roles within those projects, and interact with AI agents to accomplish tasks and receive insights.

## Database Structure

The database consists of the following main tables:

1. User
   - id (primary key)
   - username
   - email
   - password_hash
   - is_admin

2. Project
   - id (primary key)
   - name
   - description
   - user_id (foreign key to User)
   - created_at
   - updated_at

3. ProviderSettings
   - id (primary key)
   - provider_name
   - api_key
   - organization_id
   - base_url

4. Role
   - id (primary key)
   - name
   - description
   - system_message
   - temperature
   - project_id (foreign key to Project)
